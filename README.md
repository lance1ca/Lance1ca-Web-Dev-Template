# Lance1ca-Web-Dev-Template

This is a strong template for a website. I have made this repository so I just have to clone it, copy the files within the folder into my desired git folder or local holder, run "npm i" to install the necessary packages, create a .env file, and then I can start making a website based off of this template.
